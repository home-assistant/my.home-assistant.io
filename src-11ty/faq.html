<div class="section-header">What does My Home Assistant solve?</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    To be more helpful, the documentation wants to link the user to a specific
    page in their instance. However, each Home Assistant instance is hosted at a
    different url.
  </p>
  <p>
    My Home Assistant allows users to store the URL of their instance so that
    the documentation can link the user directly to the right page in their
    instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    All the data is stored in your browser. At no point will any data leave your
    network. My Home Assistant only redirects you to pages that provide you with
    information about your instance or help you start an action.
  </p>
  <p>
    Following a link from My Home Assistant will never make any changes to your
    instance.
  </p>

<div class="section-header">
  Why do I get a "404 Not Found" when I open a link?
</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>This website requires you to run at least Home Assistant 2021.3.</p>
</div>

<div class="section-header">
  Will this allow anyone to link me to any url on my instance?
</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    No, this is not possible. All links and their parameters are pre-defined in
    this website and in the "my" integration in Home Assistant.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section-header">
  How can I disable this website from working for my instance?
</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    This website does not work unless you configure the URL of your Home
    Assistant instance.
