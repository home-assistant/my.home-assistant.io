<div class="section-header">What does My Home Assistant solve?</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    To be more helpful, the documentation wants to link the user to a specific
    page in their instance. However, each Home Assistant instance is hosted at a
    different url.
  </p>
  <p>
    My Home Assistant allows users to store the URL of their instance so that
    the documentation can link the user directly to the right page in their
    instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    All the data is stored in your browser. At no point will any data leave your
    network. My Home Assistant only redirects you to pages that provide you with
    information about your instance or help you start an action.
  </p>
  <p>
    Following a link from My Home Assistant will never make any changes to your
    instance.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section-header" id="supported-pages">What pages are supported?</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    The following pages are supported:
  </p>
  <ul>
    {% for redirect in redirects %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ redirect | redirectExamplePath }}">
        {{ redirect.description | title }}
      </a>
      <br />
      <i>Introduced in Home Assistant Core {{ redirect.introduced }}.</i>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section-header" id='cannot-connect'>
  Why can't this site fetch information about my instance?
</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    There can be various reasons for My Home Assistant not to be able to connect.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>You have not configured the correct Home Assistant instance URL. <a href='/?change=1'>Update instance URL</a></li>
    <li>Home Assistant Core should be version 2021.3 or higher. Upgrade your instance to use My Home Assistant.</li>
    <li>You have overridden the default CORS settings for the HTTP integration and have not included <code>https://my.home-assistant.io</code>.
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="section-header">
  Why do I get a 404 Not Found when I open a link?
</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    This website requires an instance to run at least Home Assistant 2021.3.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section-header">
  Will this allow anyone to link me to any url on my instance?
</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    No, this is not possible. All pages in Home Assistant that are linkable and
    their supported parameters are pre-defined in this website and in the "my"
    integration in Home Assistant.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section-header">
  How can I disable this website from working for my instance?
</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    This website requires Home Assistant to have the "my" integration enabled.
    If you don't have this integration set up, links from this website won't
    work.
  </p>
</div>
